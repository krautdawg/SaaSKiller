      <h2>Salesforce for Small Teams: $20,000+ Per Year for Enterprise Features You Don't Need</h2>
      <p>
        There is a specific moment when a small business makes a catastrophic decision:
      </p>
      <p>
        "We're growing. We should probably use Salesforce. It's the industry standard."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how you end up spending $39,600+ annually to manage 10 salespeople with a system designed for 500-person enterprises.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Salesforce Sounds Good (And Why That's The Problem)</h3>

      <p>
        Salesforce is the industry standard. It's true. It's also irrelevant for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are not a large enterprise. You don't need:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Custom Apex code execution</li>
        <li>Advanced forecasting for 200+ salespeople</li>
        <li>Multi-currency accounting across global subsidiaries</li>
        <li>Sandbox environments for testing customizations</li>
        <li>Enterprise-grade audit trails for compliance</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You need a place to track deals. Salesforce is like buying a semi-truck to deliver groceries.
      </p>

      <h3>The Real Cost of Salesforce (For Your Team)</h3>

            <td style={{ padding: '12px' }}>Einstein Analytics (predictive features)</td>

            <td style={{ padding: '12px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Year 1 Total Cost</td>
            <td style={{ padding: '12px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>$105,800–$158,200+</td>

          <tr>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        That's roughly $120,000 per year to manage 10 salespeople. For most small businesses, that's a junior developer's salary or your entire marketing budget.
      </p>

      <h3>Why You'll Implement It Wrong (And It's Salesforce's Fault)</h3>

      <p>
        Salesforce is infinitely customizable. That's its strength and your trap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Out of the box, Salesforce does nothing. It requires:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Configuration.</strong> Custom fields, objects, relationships, workflows, and automation rules. Someone has to design this.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration.</strong> Your email (Outlook), meeting software (Calendar), accounting system (QuickBooks)—Salesforce doesn't talk to any of them by default. You need Zapier or native integrations (more cost).</li>
        <li><strong>Training.</strong> Your sales team won't use it unless they're trained. And even then, they won't use it the way you configured it.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance.</strong> When Salesforce updates, your customizations sometimes break. Your admin spends weeks fixing things that weren't broken.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        A small business doesn't have a dedicated Salesforce admin. So either:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You hire a consultant at $150–$300/hour to do it (burning budget)</li>
        <li>Someone from your team becomes the "Salesforce person" (they leave, and you're stuck)</li>
        <li>You buy a third-party managed service ($500–$5,000/month) to run it for you</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You wanted to track deals. Instead, you now have a full-time job maintaining software that does most of what a spreadsheet does, only slower.
      </p>

      <h3>What Actually Happens in 18 Months</h3>

      <p>
        Month 0: "Salesforce is the future of our business."
      </p>

      <p>
        Month 3: "Why is it so slow? Why does it have 8 different ways to report the same thing?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Month 6: Your salespeople are avoiding it. They're tracking deals in Excel because it's faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        Month 12: You're paying $20,000/year but only 40% of your team uses it regularly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Month 18: You're locked in. Migrating 2 years of deal history to another system is a nightmare. Your admin is the only person who knows how it works. You're stuck paying rent forever.
      </p>

      <h3>When You Actually Might Need Salesforce</h3>

      <p>
        Salesforce makes sense if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You have 50+ salespeople and genuinely need advanced forecasting</li>
        <li>You're in an industry with regulatory requirements (healthcare, finance)</li>
        <li>You already have a dedicated Salesforce admin who loves maintaining it</li>
        <li>You can afford $100,000+/year and treat it as a strategic investment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If none of those apply, you're wasting money.
      </p>

      <h3>What You Should Do Instead</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use HubSpot Sales Hub ($600–$3,000/year)</strong> – works out of the box, integrates with email and calendar automatically, doesn't require an admin</li>
        <li><strong>Use Pipedrive ($780–$2,640/year)</strong> – built specifically for deal tracking, much simpler than Salesforce</li>
        <li><strong>Use a spreadsheet with Zapier ($20–$100/month)</strong> – sounds dumb, actually works for 10-person teams</li>
        <li><strong>Use Notion ($0–$120/year)</strong> – if you're already in Notion for everything, add a CRM database there</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All of these cost 1/10th what Salesforce does. All of them work better for teams your size.
      </p>

          The SaaSKiller Take
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: 0, marginBottom: '12px' }}>
          Salesforce is enterprise software. You are not an enterprise. Buying it for a 10-person team
          is like leasing a corporate jet to pick up groceries.
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
          You'll spend $100,000+ in Year 1, become dependent on one person who understands it, and struggle
          to leave because you have 2 years of deal history locked inside. Choose literally anything else.
        </p>
